# Physics-Engine
2D Physics Engine with collision mechanics implemented over rigid spherical bodies under elastic compression. Next update to the project would be collision mechanics over rigid bodies but of different convex shapes. 
Eventually I also plan on adding fluid mechanics and fluid models.
